#some notes:
# local mode is the easiest to capture just the game traffic
# allow hosts filters the traffic to just the grpc stuff which is what we actually care about
#the script is the most important part, it reads a descriptor set file output by our CLI tool, 
# then uses it to decide which requests to stream, displays them nicely in the UI, and writes them to disk
